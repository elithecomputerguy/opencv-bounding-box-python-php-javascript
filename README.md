# opencv-bounding-box-python-php-javascript
Scan a folder of images with OpenCV, output to text file, use PHP to create web page with bounding boxes around images detected.


The python script scans a folder of images with OpenCV and then writes the image names with coordinates of objects deteted to a text file

The PHP script reads the text file that was created and then uses Javascript/ Canvas to place images on a web page and draw bounding boxes around the objects that have been detected.

This is good for understanding what OpenCV "sees" and understanding false positive hits.
